slurmstepd: error: *** JOB 19999780 ON spartan-bm085 CANCELLED AT 2020-09-17T04:33:25 DUE TO TIME LIMIT ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [[28559,0],0] on node spartan-bm085
  Remote daemon: [[28559,0],7] on node spartan-bm111

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.
